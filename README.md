**Abstract**  
The urban phase of the Indus Civilisation (c.2500 to 1900 BC) spanned areas with extremely diverse environments, where two rainfall systems, winter and summer, overlap. The decline of Indus urban is often linked to the regional-to-local consequences of the 4.2 ka BP climate change event, so the Indus Civilisation creates an opportunity to examine how societies can respond to climate change events that are detrimental to food production.  
The multi-disciplinary TwoRains project is looking beyond the coincidence of climate change and the onset of Indus urban decline to understand human adaptation to variable rainfall systems, the local expressions of climate change, human response to it, and the resilience and sustainability of the choices that were made in the face of variable and changing climate. Focussing on NW India, the project has collected data on settlement distribution and material culture, but also evidence of water stress, food production and consumption. As a step towards synthesing data and reaching a robust explanation of the possible connections between climate and societal change, we are developing an agent-based modelling programme to explore if and how the diversity in cropping strategies affects the productivity and resilience of small local producers. We are particularly interested in exploring how these factors operate when farmers were coping with diverse and changing environments, and how it would impact the levels of regional food production required for maintaining urban centres.
